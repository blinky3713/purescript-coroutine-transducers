# purescript-coroutine-transducers

This library adds a transducer layer to [purescript-coroutines](https://github.com/purescript-contrib/purescript-coroutines)
to allow for intermediate processing phases that are effectful. The implementation was taken directly from Mario Blazevic's [Coroutine Pipelines](https://themonadreader.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/issue19.pdf).
